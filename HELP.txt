Howdy, it's THE jelloman639

So... Matt I was wondering what IDE you are using because I'm having trouble installing the pygame 
module onto my PC. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have the current Python version installed,
but I'm not sure if I have pip installed and if I do, how to use it. I'm using PyCharm as my IDE.

Thanks,

Hey, MattZ45986 speaking...

I use Python's IDLE (3.6 64-bit). To get pip, follow the instructions on "https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/".
To install pygame, put this --> "py -m pip install -U pygame --user" in the command prompt and you should get a result
a loading bar and a download within the prompt. If it says there is a syntax error, that is because pip isn't installed.
Now, if after all of this doesn't work, it is probably because python isn't on the windows PATH.
Follow the instructions here "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3701646/how-to-add-to-the-pythonpath-in-windows-7".
By the way, PyCharm should be fine. Hope that helps!
