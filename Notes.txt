This is where we will keep all of our notes and ideas for the game.
Since we are just starting out, I think it is appropriate to use a simple, if maybe old-fashioned GUI just to keep things doable.  For this reason I think we should use tkinterfor our interface.
tkinter is the standard graphical user interface for python users and will give us all the functinoality needed for our game.
Given, it will not look amazing, but we if we find another interface that is just as easy to use and is better looking, we'll use that.
Some open options are blender and unity, two very solid game engines, both free, but a bit more complicated.
