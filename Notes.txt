This is where we will keep all of our notes and ideas for the game.

Update 1.0.0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a link for a very helpful tutorial about pygame, the module we will be using for our game: 
https://pythonprogramming.net/pygame-python-3-part-1-intro/

Before pygame will work, though, you have to install it to your computer along with python if you don't already have it. 
Once these are loaded, you can use them and test out the new code in the example code file.

Update 1.0.1 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the outer workings of the game, there is a lot to sort out.  Because this is our first game it shouldn't be anything too ambitious.
We'll save that for our final project.  We should make it 2D, but the question is: what kind of game should it be?
It has to be timeless, playable, preferably with a two player option, and it has to be simplistic yet classy.
I've chosen some basic game genres. Feel free to add to the list.

-Tower Defense
-"Battle Cats" style defense
-Angry Birds
-Fighting
-Simulator
-Racing
-Party/Group games
-Battle Royale :)
-Arcade
-Puzzle
-One-button-bob

The basic look of the games in all instances would be about the same: same color scheme, menu, and the like.
It would just be the actual game that was different. Speaking of color scheme, that also has to be decided.
Like in any serious game, the look of the game could make or break it.  Obviously we can't make crazy graphics.
However, we can make a classy black theme with neon highlights: think "Axe", "5 gum", etc. It doesn't look bad.
Also, since we don't have the skills to make amazing characters and detailed environments, an arcade background would do
Our characters/gameplay objects would be colored shapes in a black arcade style environment.
Of course the extent of this theme would depend on the type of game chosen, but all-in-all pretty universal.

Update 1.0.2 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tower Defense:
  neon path, diff. powered shape towers
  neon expolosions, diff. colored enemies
  Pros: FUN, simple, dynamic, timeless
  Cons: Many levels
  
"Battle Cats":
  white home base, enemy black base
  send diff. colored attack untis against black's
  Pros: FUN, two player cooperative
  Cons: Many levels, lots of menus for level up screens
  
Angry Birds:
  break enemy's base w/ colored, powered shapes
  TNT, and diff. materials rep. by colors
  Pros: timeless, familiar
  Cons: SO many levels, it's been done before
  
Fighting:
  Not exactly sure how this would work
  Pros: challenge
  Cons: theme won't work
  
Simulator:
  In a black world, build using shapes.
  Combine shapes to get new materials
  Pros: very dynamic, two-player possible
  Cons: very complicated, possibly limited
  
Racing: 
  Again, don't exatly have a vision for this
  Pros: racing is cool
  Cons: don't know how it would work, yet.
  
Party Game:
  play diff. games in a black plane
  tag, capture flag, simon says, etc.
  Pros: very multiplayer
  Cons: a bit involved
  
Battle Royale:
  fight AI or friends in a black plane
  bushes, building, and weapons as shapes
  Pros: free-for-all fun, it worked for Fortnite
  Cons: AI programming(not too bad), big
  
Arcade:
  play tetris/mario/pacman type game
  Pros: retro, simple, playable
  Cons: old, maybe too easy

Puzzle:
  solve a puzzle problem made in the game
  Pros: simple, easy
  Cons: simple, easy
  
One-button-bob:
  basically a game where only one button is used
  does a variety of things, trying to dodge obstacles
  Pros: very simple, fun, timeless
  Cons: lots of obstacles, once and done

This has been an overview of the types of game we can make.  Again, feel free to give suggestions.
Look at the pros and cons of each: I feel like our game should be one of the folowing:
Tower Defense, Battle Cats, Battle Royale, One-button-bob
These game seem to be 1. the most fun 2. the easiest for beginners 3. games that will be played

Please add any thoughts: this file should only grow.

Update 1.1.0 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I (MattZ45986) have added some example code to show you the power and simplicity of the pygame module.
Use the friendly Bob.png file and the pygame module(you have to download Bob into the script's folder)
When executed properly, you should be able to move bob around to all edges of the black screen.

Update 1.1.1 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MattZ45986 here again, and this time with a tower defense protoype that sends in enemies with every key press.
If we were to make a tower defense game, this is what it would look like on the most basic level.
Use the Tower-Defense-Prototype.py code in the same folder as the Dot.png file, both of which are new.

Update 1.1.2 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This update includes a modification of the tower-defense-prototype code. Now, keys affect the speed of enemies.
When 1 is pressed an enemy comes out at speed one. When 9 is pressed, a nine-speed enemy is spawned.
This will mimic the game in that there will be different speed enemies.
